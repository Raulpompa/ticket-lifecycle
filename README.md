<h1>osTicket lifecycle: Creating and Working Tickets</h1>
<p>This lab simulates the process of managing IT support tickets in the osTicket system. We will create tickets as end-users, observe ticket properties, and set specific priorities, departments, and SLAs. As help desk agents, we will then work on resolving tickets, including adjusting access levels and managing ticket visibility. The lab also emphasizes the importance of documenting every support task, regardless of whether it’s handled immediately, to ensure proper tracking and metrics. Additionally, we will explore the email notification system and practice ticket resolution to build technical skills and familiarity with the ticketing process.</p>
<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Azure VM
- Remote Desktop
- osTicket
<h2>Process Demonstration</h2>
<p>
  <p>I'll begin by visiting the end user site of osTicket to create a new ticket.</p>

</p>
<p>
  <p>I will now log in as the "worker" agent we created in the configuration section.</p>

<p>
  <p>Make sure to refresh the page for the ticket to appear.</p>

</p>
<p>
  <p>We can now see the open ticket. Now I'll click on it to start working on it.</p>

</p>
<p>
  <p>When I click on a ticket, I can access a detailed view that includes important information such as the ticket's priority level, service level agreement (SLA), creation date, and any updates or notes associated with it. Additionally, I can see the status of the ticket, assigned agents, due dates, and any other relevant data that helps in managing and resolving the ticket effectively.</p>

</p>
<p>
  <p>I can modify the SLA of a ticket when necessary by clicking on the "SLA Plan" section. Once I make the change, I have the option to add a note to record the reason for the adjustment. This helps ensure that all updates are tracked and provides context for other agents or users involved in the ticket resolution process.</p>

<p>
  <p>Here, I will assign the ticket to the Online Banking department, where I will later handle it as a SysAdmin.</p>

</p>
<p>
  <p>Here, I logged in as the System Administrator, Jane, to complete the ticket.</p>

<p>
  <p>Here, I am notifying the agent John that I have received the ticket.</p>

<p>
  <p>Here, I'll be opening a new Ticket as Ken.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q0t0RKN.png"  alt="osTicket Lifecycle"/>
</p>
<p>
  <p>I've logged in as John, and we can see an open ticket submitted by Ken.</p>

</p>
<p>
  <p>Since the scenario isn’t of high severity, I will change the SLA to C.</p>

  <p>Let's say that restarting Adobe after lunch worked, and the ticket is now resolved.</p>

<h2>osTicket Lifecycle Completed!</h2>
<p>In this project, we created and managed tickets in osTicket from both end-user and help desk perspectives. We configured ticket properties, assigned them to appropriate departments, and worked through resolving issues. By switching roles, we learned the importance of tracking all IT tasks and how ticketing systems help with organizing and managing requests. This hands-on experience with osTicket builds the foundation for effectively using ticketing systems in real-world help desk environments. Regular practice and exploration are key to mastering the system.</p>
