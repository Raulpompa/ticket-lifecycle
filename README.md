<h1>osTicket lifecycle: Creating and Working Tickets</h1>
<p>This lab simulates the process of managing IT support tickets in the osTicket system. We will create tickets as end-users, observe ticket properties, and set specific priorities, departments, and SLAs. As help desk agents, we will then work on resolving tickets, including adjusting access levels and managing ticket visibility. The lab also emphasizes the importance of documenting every support task, regardless of whether itâ€™s handled immediately, to ensure proper tracking and metrics. Additionally, we will explore the email notification system and practice ticket resolution to build technical skills and familiarity with the ticketing process.</p>
